## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

There were no challenges in building the app for the required features. I had wanted to more functionalities for the BioBuilder App, but couldn't achieve them because they are advanced features. Hopefully, when I start the class, I would be able to learn how to integrate those features.
